# Jinx

Jinx is a set of minimalist mechanics to run a Role Playing Game. The game is an ability-based tabletop roleplaying game. This initial set of rules is designed to support games set up in the current world. Yet, it is important to understand that Jinx is, first and foremost, a set of mechanics to help telling stories, and can be easily adapted to support other settings. To do this, you just need to change the list of abilities.

Jinx is a minimal ruleset which will help you run your plotted campaigns. It is a framework which is aimed to help Storytellers to resolve actions and to help characters grow. What you are reading is not a full-fledged role playing game, but you can adapt it to every setting you like.

## Game Mechanics

The game mechanics are based on abilities. The focus is given to which actions the player characters are able to perform and with which degree of success. An action is resolved by comparing a specific threshold to the ability level summed to a roll of a dice.

Every ability value in Jinx, as well as the thresholds, varies between 0 and 100.

The mechanics define two types of actions: challenged and unchallenged.

### Unchallenged Actions

Unchallenged actions are those a character do without being opposed by another character's action. In this category fall actions as shooting, investigation, swimming and so on. The Storyteller defines a threshold, and the player character should score mor than the threshold by adding 1d20 to their ability value.

`action result = ability + 1d20`

### Challenged Actions

When a character wants to perform an action which another character can oppose with another skill, we have a challenged action. Examples of challenged actions are melee fighting, persuasion vs willpower,
In a challenged action, instead of comparing the action result to a threshold, we compare two action results: the action and the opposed action.

### Thresholds

In Jinx, a generic thresholds level should be considered as such:

Difficulty|Threshold
---|---:
Daily|15
Simple|25
Difficult|50
Challenging|75
Extreme|85+

### Degree of success

Succeeding in an action is rarely a yes/no result. In Jinx, the result of an action identifies the degree of success or failure. The degree of success is a value that ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 is a minimal success (or failure) while a 5 is a spectacular one. Every 20 points of difference between the threshold and the action result, the degree of success is raised by 1 point.

Difference|Degree of Success
---|---:
0-19|1
20-39|2
40-59|3
60-79|4
80+|5

The degree of success is the multiplier for any weapon damage.

### Critical Roll

Every time a natural 1 or a natural 20 are rolled, the roll is considered critical. A natural 1 will remove 20 points from the character ability value. A natural 20 will add 40 points to it.

### Untrained actions

In addition to a list of abilities, Jinx uses the idea of traits. Each character is defined by three traits: body, mind and spirit. These traits determine the starting point of each ability. If a character is not trained in a specific ability, instead of using their ability value, they will use their trait value and they will have the possibility to become proficient in that ability.

### A note on combat

Combat is no different than any other action in Jinx. Someone expert in melee can attack or parry if attacked. There is no initiative or rounds; players declare their actions and the actions are carried out in the order in which they are declared. If a single character wants to do multiple actions in comparison with other

## Character Creation

There are two element of a character creation: boring numbers and exciting stories. The mechanics of the games help define a character through a series of stats which identifies each character's ability. Yet, the most important part in the creation of a character is their backstory and their personality.

### Traits

The foundation of a character are their traits. Each character has 30 points to distribute between the three traits

- **Body** : the natural level of a character's physical prowess
- **Mind** : the logical ability of a character
- **Spirit** : a character's attunement to the world of feelings

### Abilities

In Jinx, abilities are the cornerstone of the action resolution. Each ability belongs to one of the three traits. Each character starts their journey with a total of 60 points to distribute amongst their abilities. The starting value of each ability is the value of the trait the ability belongs to. A character can distribute the points in how many abilities they feel like; however, the player cannot assign more than 20 points to a single ability.

Deciding how to distribute points is an art more than a science. Putting a few points in many abilities may generate a jack of all trades which is the master of none. On the other side picking only three abilities maxed out to 20 points each will generate strong weaknesses in the character. As a rule of thumb, picking 6 abilities and distributing the points amongst those generates a rounded, balanced character with strength and weaknesses alike.

### Backstory

Role playing game is much more than numbers. While Jinx focuses on game mechanics, it also recognises the importance of having well rounded characters. A character can thrive only when its player understand the story and the motives for the character to exists. These can be identified by telling how the character came to be. A simple way to write a backstory is to start from their traits and abilities. By using those as blueprint to identify each character's past, it is easy to write a consistent backstory.

Please note we stand for storytelling, and storytellers should rely on characters' backstory to create personal, intense adventures. While this is not easily measurable as a simple stat, we highly recommend to focus on this. Not only it will give storytellers ways of making campaigns more interesting for the players; it will help players get in character much faster and with more intensity.

### Character psychology

Many times players have trouble bonding with their characters, because of the complexity of the separation between player and character. To simplify players' lives and provide storytellers with a simple way of understanding a character, Jinx strongly suggests each player to run a personality test as if in their character's shoes. The simplest way of identifying a character psychology is through a "five big personalities" test (https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test). This test produces a very simple outcome called OCEAN Model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits) that defines five element of a personality:
* Openness to experience _(inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)_
* Conscientiousness _(efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless)_
* Extraversion _(outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)_
* Agreeableness _(friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/detached)_
* Neuroticism _(sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident)_

### Life Points and Death

As in every roleplaying games, the rules surrounding death include elements as life points and when a character dies. Jinx is no different, every character has 40 life points + their body value.

When a character loses all their life points due to damages, they die. An injured character can recover their life points either by resting, at the rate of 1 point per hour of rest, or with the help of medical abilities.

`life points = 40 + body`

When heavily damaged, characters have penalties to their actions.

Remaining Life Points|Actions Penalty
---|---:
10-20|10
0-10|20

### Characters' strength at creation

The initial 60 points define a character as a beginner. This is the default starting point for each character; however, it is at the Storyteller discretion to alter this value. Offering more points to the players will generate stronger characters. A character with 120 points to distribute is relatively powerful, while one with 150 or more is extremely powerful. One element to keep into consideration is the limit of 20 points per ability, which cease to be relevant if the Storyteller decides to awards more point for the characters creation.

## Character Progression

Jinx consider characters' progression as a progression in their abilities. Characters' traits and life points remains the same for the entire life of a character. Characters become better at doing what they do, therefore they are allowed to grow after each played session.

Each time a character successfully uses an ability, then they can try and level it up at the end of each session. At storytellers' discretion, the ability can be levelled up even without an open roll, when a character performs an action which does not necessarily require a roll.

It is both the storyteller's and the players' responsibility to keep track of which abilities have been successfully used in each session.

### Life Experience and Bonus points

Each session, the storyteller should award 3 points to each character to signify an increased life experience. Any particularly good part played by a character should also be rewarded with bonus points. These points can be used at the end of each session to level up the player characters' abilities.

### Levelling up abilities

Each time a player character can level up an ability, they will have to roll 1d100 and score higher than the current ability value. The characters will raise their ability by the degree of success obtained. The level up is not automatic, and it is more challenging to achieve the higher the character's abilities are.

If players have life experience points or bonus points, they can either use them to roll on an ability they already have, or to increase the degree of success of a previous roll. The application of bonus points can move a degree of failure to a degree of success. No ability can be raised by more than 5 points in a single session.

Life experience points and bonus points don't need to be expended all at the same time, but can be kept to be used at a later time.

### Learning new abilities

Player characters learn new abilities just by trying and use them when unskilled. In such case, the player will try and succeed in an action by using the trait value instead of the ability value with a penalty of 5. If the character succeeds in the action, at the end of the session they will be allowed to level up the ability as every other ability, rolling the 1d100 against the trait instead of the ability.

## Ability list

Jinx is a core mechanics, which means it has no direct link to any specific settings. To create a baseline and help storytellers and players alike with examples of abilities, Jinx focuses on a contemporary game, where characters live in a 2019 world.

It is also important to notice that Jinx is a minimalist game, which means that it tries to group similar skills under one ability.
