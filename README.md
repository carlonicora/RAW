RAW is a tabletop role-playing game designed with simplicity at its core.

It uses broad abilities instead of detailed skills or levels, allowing players to focus on character development and storytelling. Character progression is measured in increased abilities more than levels

In RAW, abilities are generalised to emphasise the story more than the ability check.

This simplicity promotes a story-driven experience, where the game master uses flexibility and creativity to lead the game.

RAW encourages a story-driven approach, with the game master using common sense and fun to use the relevant abilities to resolve conflicts.

The system works for any setting, from fantasy to futuristic. Abilities adapt to the context; for example, "technology" might mean different things in different worlds. RAW is all about keeping things broad and flexible to enhance the story, rather than getting caught up in complex rules.
