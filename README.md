RAW is a tabletop role-playing game designed with simplicity at its core. It simplifies traditional TTRPG mechanics by using a broad-strokes approach to abilities. Unlike games with extensive lists of skills, RAW condenses them into a few versatile abilities. This design lets players act decisively without getting bogged down in rules. For instance, a character skilled in melee can excel in both sword fighting and unarmed combat using the same ability score. This streamlined system keeps the focus on action and narrative progression.

This simplicity promotes a story-driven experience, where the game master uses common sense and creativity to lead the game.

RAW makes it easier to start playing TTRPGs. Unlike games like 5e with many rules and manuals, RAW is simple. It has fewer rules, so new players can quickly become game masters (GMs). There's no need to know every rule or worry about players min-maxing their characters. RAW focuses on fun and storytelling, using the Rule of Cool (RoC) to keep the game exciting and accessible for everyone.

The system works for any setting, from fantasy to futuristic. Abilities adapt to the context; for example, "technology" might mean different things in different worlds. RAW is all about keeping things broad and flexible to enhance the story, rather than getting caught up in complex rules.

## Character Creation
In this chapter, we'll dive into creating a character for RAW, a process that sets the stage for your adventures. Unlike other TTRPGs, RAW doesn’t confine characters to specific archetypes or classes. Instead, the abilities you choose carve out your character's identity and capabilities. By selecting abilities that resonate with your vision, you shape who your character is and how they interact with the world.

A character's experience and proficiency in various fields are represented by the percentage scale of abilities, which is the core factor in determining success. This approach emphasises that a character's ability value play a more significant role than luck in their actions. While dice rolls add an element of chance, they range only from 1 to 20, making the ability percentage the dominant factor. This system underscores that a character's success is largely due to their expertise and training, rather than random luck, highlighting the importance of strategic ability allocation.

Let's start this journey of crafting a unique character tailored to your story in the world of RAW.

### Step 1: Allocating Ability Points
Character creation begins with the allocation of ability points, forming the foundation of your character’s strengths and weaknesses.

Each character is granted 100 points to distribute among the following abilities:

| Ability                 | Short Description                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Athletics**           | Physical prowess in actions like running, jumping    |
| **Art and Craft**       | Creativity and skill in making and designing         |
| **Drive/Pilot**         | Proficiency in controlling vehicles and crafts       |
| **Education**           | Knowledge and learning ability                       |
| **Empathy/Psychology**  | Understanding and influencing emotions               |
| **Intimidate/Persuade** | Coercion and convincing others                       |
| **Investigation**       | Skill in analysing information                       |
| **Medicine**            | Knowledge and practice of healing                    |
| **Melee Combat**        | Proficiency in close-quarters combat                 |
| **Occult/Magic**        | Understanding of mystical forces and occult elements |
| **Perception**          | Ability to notice subtle details and changes         |
| **Ranged Combat**       | Skill in using ranged weapons                        |
| **Stealth/Survival**    | Proficiency in avoiding detection and enduring       |
| **Technology**          | Expertise in modern and advanced tools or repair     |
| **Willpower**           | Mental fortitude and discipline                      |

Choosing how to distribute these points is crucial. A broad approach makes a character adaptable, while a focused one creates a specialist. This decision sets the stage for your character’s role and how they will navigate the challenges of a campaign.

### Step 2: Passive Abilities
In RAW, abilities also have a passive aspect. For every 20 points in an ability, you get 1 passive point. This shows automatic skills, like defence or mental resistance. For example, if you're good in melee, you're also better at avoiding harm. If you have strong willpower, it's harder for others to read your mind. Knowing your passive points helps you understand what your character can do naturally, without trying.

Understanding these passive abilities is crucial for players, as they define how characters inherently react and protect themselves in the game world, even without active efforts from the player.

| Ability Value | Passive Ability |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 0-19          | 0               |
| 20-39         | 1               |
| 40-59         | 2               |
| 60-79         | 3               |
| 80-99         | 4               |
| 100+          | 5               |

### Step 3: Life Points
Life points in RAW measure your character's physical and mental health. To find your life points, add 20 to the sum of your passive willpower and passive athletics values. This total shows how tough and resilient your character is.

Life points track the wellbeing of your character. If they drop to 0, your character dies. Falling below 10 life points means your character is seriously hurt. Challenges become harder, adding a 20-point penalty to all your rolls. This penalty reflects the struggle of pushing through pain and injury.

### Step 4: Character Story
Playing RPGs is about more than just numbers. While RAW focuses on mechanics, it also values the creation of well-rounded characters. A character comes alive through their backstory, shaped by the player’s understanding of their motives and origins.

To develop a rich and believable character in RAW, following these steps provides a solid starting point. Each phase of the narrative construction adds layers to your character, offering depth and relatability. Let's explore these steps to effectively define your character:

- **Backstory:** Initiating with the backstory sets the foundation, giving insight into the character's origins and how past events have shaped their personality and abilities.
- **Notable Characters in Your Past:** Recognising key individuals in your character’s life helps to flesh out their social and emotional landscape, showing how relationships have influenced their development.
- **Want:** This is the character's conscious desire or goal. It's what they believe will bring them happiness, fulfilment, or success. In a story, the "want" is often the driving force that propels the character into action and shapes their journey. It's the external objective they're striving to achieve, like winning a competition, finding a lost treasure, or achieving fame.
- **Need:** Unlike "want," the "need" is something the character may not be aware of but is essential for their growth or transformation. It represents an internal fulfilment that truly satisfies their deeper, often unacknowledged, desires. The "need" is what the character requires to resolve inner conflicts and achieve real happiness or peace. It's about personal growth, understanding, and emotional or moral enlightenment.
- **Where Were You 5 Years Ago and What Happened:** This snapshot in time reveals a crucial chapter in your character’s life, highlighting transformative experiences that have led to their current situation.
- **Who Have You Wronged:** Reflecting on past conflicts or transgressions adds complexity to your character, offering opportunities for growth and redemption.

Incorporating this information into your character's backstory is crucial for the Game Master to craft a more personalised story. It's important to be concise; your backstory should not be an exhaustive book but rather a summary of key information. The GM will likely be juggling multiple backstories, so presenting yours in a clear and accessible format will greatly assist them. A well-organised and straightforward backstory allows the GM to easily integrate your character's narrative into the game, enhancing the overall experience for everyone involved. Consider using bullet points: they are easy to read and remember.

## Abilities
In RAW, abilities are the foundation of your character's skills and determine their effectiveness in various situations. Each ability represents a broad range of related actions and competencies. Below is a detailed explanation of each ability and how it can be applied in different settings like fantasy, cyberpunk, or space opera.

### Athletics
This covers your character's physical activities such as running, jumping, and climbing. In a fantasy setting, it might mean scaling a castle wall, while in a cyberpunk world, it could involve sprinting through neon-lit streets to evade security drones.

### Art and Craft
Reflects creativity and the ability to make or design things. Whether painting a masterpiece in a medieval world or creating a holographic sculpture in a futuristic society, this ability is key.

### Drive/Pilot
Indicates proficiency with vehicles, whether it's driving a horse-drawn carriage, piloting a starship through an asteroid field, or manoeuvring a hover-bike in a high-tech city.

### Education
Represents knowledge and academic learning. This ability could be used to decipher ancient texts in a fantasy library or to understand complex quantum algorithms in a cyberpunk reality.

### Empathy/Psychology
Involves understanding and influencing emotions and behaviour. It's as useful in negotiating with a tribal leader in a fantasy game as it is in profiling a cybercriminal in a futuristic setting.

### Intimidate/Persuade
Encompasses both coercion and convincing others. This might mean threatening a city guard to gain information or persuading a corporation executive to fund an expedition in space.

### Investigation
The skill in gathering and analysing information, crucial for solving mysteries in a gothic horror campaign or uncovering corporate espionage in a cyberpunk thriller.

### Medicine
Knowledge of healing, applicable in treating plague victims in a medieval world or performing cybernetic surgery in a sci-fi universe.

### Melee Combat
Shows proficiency in close-quarters combat, whether swinging a sword in a fantasy battle or engaging in a cyber-enhanced fistfight in a dystopian metropolis.

### Occult/Magic
Understanding mystical forces, relevant in casting spells in a fantasy realm or manipulating arcane energies in an alternative reality.

### Perception
The ability to notice subtle details, important for spotting an ambush in a dark fantasy forest or detecting a hidden surveillance device in a futuristic office.

### Ranged Combat
Skill in using ranged weapons, from firing a longbow in a medieval siege to operating a plasma rifle during a space station assault.

### Stealth/Survival
Proficiency in avoiding detection and enduring harsh conditions, essential for moving unseen through enemy territory or surviving in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

### Technology
Expertise in modern and futuristic tools and technology, from repairing a steam engine in a steampunk city to hacking a security network in a cyberpunk world.

### Willpower
Represents mental strength and discipline, crucial for resisting magical enchantment in a fantasy setting or withstanding psychological manipulation in a corporate warfare scenario.

Understanding and choosing the right abilities for your character will greatly influence their role in the game and how they interact with the world around them. Each setting offers unique challenges and opportunities for these abilities to shine.

## Action Resolution
In RAW, the mechanics revolve around abilities, which not only determine the actions players can perform but also their success level. Actions are resolved by comparing the result of an ability check to a predetermined threshold. The ability check consists of a character’s ability score plus a roll of a d20.

In RAW, the concept of thresholds and degrees of success are interconnected, forming the backbone of action resolution. The threshold is a benchmark number that an action result must meet or exceed to succeed. Here's how they relate:

- **Thresholds** define the difficulty level of an action, ranging from trivial to extreme. These levels are not arbitrary; they are set on a scale from 20 to 100, reflecting the challenge posed by the task at hand.
- **Degrees of Success** expand on this by quantifying how well an action was performed. The degree of success is determined by the difference between the action result (ability score plus dice roll) and the threshold. This difference is then translated into a success level, ranging from 1 to 6, where 1 represents a minimal success and 6 a spectacular success.

For example, if a task has a difficulty threshold of 40 (simple), and a character’s action result is 60, the difference is 20. According to the degrees of success table, this difference falls within the 20-39 range, equating to a degree of success of 2. This system ensures that the outcome of actions is not just a binary success or failure but reflects the nuanced performance of the character in the context of the challenge they face.

Thresholds

| Difficulty  | Threshold |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Trivial     | 20        |
| Simple      | 40        |
| Difficult   | 60        |
| Challenging | 80        |
| Extreme     | 100       |

Degrees of success

| Difference | Degree of Success |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 0-19       | 1                 |
| 20-39      | 2                 |
| 40-59      | 3                 |
| 60-79      | 4                 |
| 80-99      | 5                 |
| 100+       | 6                 |


The system categorises actions into three types: automatic, unopposed, and opposed, each with distinct resolution methods.

### Automatic Actions
Not every action requires a dice roll. Automatic actions are routine or straightforward tasks that a character can accomplish without rolling, provided their ability score surpasses the relevant threshold. This approach ensures dice rolls are reserved for significant moments, enhancing their impact on the narrative. For example, a character with a 40 in an ability can automatically succeed in trivial tasks related to that ability without rolling.

### Unopposed Actions
These actions occur without direct opposition, such as shooting a target, investigating a scene, or driving a vehicle. The Game Master sets a threshold based on the task's difficulty. The player then rolls a d20, adding this to their ability score to determine the action's outcome.

`action result = ability + 1d20`

The success of unchallenged actions depends on whether the total exceeds the threshold set by the GM.

#### Opposed Actions
Opposed actions involve direct confrontation between characters, where the initiator's success depends on overcoming the opponent's passive ability. The character initiating the action rolls a d20 and adds it to their relevant ability score. To succeed, the initiator's total successes must exceed the passive ability score of the opponent.

#### Critical Rolls
A roll of 1 or 20 is critical, significantly affecting the action’s outcome. A natural 1 reduces the effective ability score by 20 for that action, while a natural 20 increases it by 20, potentially altering the degree of success.

|Ability Score|Roll|Total|Successes|
|---|---|---|---|
|35|10|45|2|
|35|1|15|0|
|35|20|75|3|

Understanding these mechanics is crucial for players and GMs alike to navigate the challenges and adventures within the RAW system effectively.
