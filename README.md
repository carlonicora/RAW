RAW is a tabletop role-playing game designed with simplicity at its core. It focuses on abilities rather than specific skills or levels. This means players use broad abilities that improve over time, making the game straightforward and easy to manage. The game doesn't get bogged down with detailsâ€”whether fighting hand-to-hand or with weapons, the approach is the same. RAW encourages storytelling, with the game master using common sense and fun to guide the action.

The system works for any setting, from fantasy to futuristic. Abilities adapt to the context; for example, "technology" might mean different things in different worlds. RAW is all about keeping things broad and flexible to enhance the story, rather than getting caught up in complex rules.
