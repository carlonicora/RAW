RAW is a tabletop role-playing game designed with simplicity at its core. It simplifies traditional TTRPG mechanics by using a broad-strokes approach to abilities. Unlike games with extensive lists of skills, RAW condenses them into a few versatile abilities. This design lets players act decisively without getting bogged down in rules. For instance, a character skilled in melee can excel in both sword fighting and unarmed combat using the same ability score. This streamlined system keeps the focus on action and narrative progression.

This simplicity promotes a story-driven experience, where the game master uses common sense and creativity to lead the game.

RAW makes it easier to start playing TTRPGs. Unlike games like 5e with many rules and manuals, RAW is simple. It has fewer rules, so new players can quickly become game masters (GMs). There's no need to know every rule or worry about players min-maxing their characters. RAW focuses on fun and storytelling, using the Rule of Cool (RoC) to keep the game exciting and accessible for everyone.

The system works for any setting, from fantasy to futuristic. Abilities adapt to the context; for example, "technology" might mean different things in different worlds. RAW is all about keeping things broad and flexible to enhance the story, rather than getting caught up in complex rules.

## Character Creation

In this chapter, we'll dive into creating a character for RAW, a process that sets the stage for your adventures. Unlike other TTRPGs, RAW doesn’t confine characters to specific archetypes or classes. Instead, the abilities you choose carve out your character's identity and capabilities. By selecting abilities that resonate with your vision, you shape who your character is and how they interact with the world.

A character's experience and proficiency in various fields are represented by the percentage scale of abilities, which is the core factor in determining success. This approach emphasises that a character's ability value play a more significant role than luck in their actions. While dice rolls add an element of chance, they range only from 1 to 20, making the ability percentage the dominant factor. This system underscores that a character's success is largely due to their expertise and training, rather than random luck, highlighting the importance of strategic ability allocation.

Let's start this journey of crafting a unique character tailored to your story in the world of RAW.

### Step 1: Allocating Ability Points

Character creation begins with the allocation of ability points, forming the foundation of your character’s strengths and weaknesses.

Each character is granted 100 points to distribute among the following abilities:

| Ability                 | Short Description                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Athletics**           | Physical prowess in actions like running, jumping |
| **Art and Craft**       | Creativity and skill in making and designing      |
| **Drive/Pilot**         | Proficiency in controlling vehicles and crafts    |
| **Education**           | Knowledge and learning ability                    |
| **Empathy/Psychology**  | Understanding and influencing emotions            |
| **Intimidate/Persuade** | Coercion and convincing others                    |
| **Investigation**       | Skill in analyzing and finding information        |
| **Medicine**            | Knowledge and practice of healing                 |
| **Melee Combat**        | Proficiency in close-quarters combat              |
| **Occult/Magic**        | Understanding of mystical forces and spells       |
| **Perception**          | Ability to notice subtle details and changes      |
| **Ranged Combat**       | Skill in using ranged weapons                     |
| **Stealth/Survival**    | Proficiency in avoiding detection and enduring    |
| **Technology**          | Expertise in modern and advanced tools            |
| **Willpower**           | Mental fortitude and discipline                   |

Choosing how to distribute these points is crucial. A broad approach makes a character adaptable, while a focused one creates a specialist. This decision sets the stage for your character’s role and how they will navigate the challenges of a campaign.

### Step 2: Passive Abilities

In RAW, abilities also have a passive aspect. For every 20 points in an ability, you get 1 passive point. This shows automatic skills, like defence or mental resistance. For example, if you're good in melee, you're also better at avoiding harm. If you have strong willpower, it's harder for others to read your mind. Knowing your passive points helps you understand what your character can do naturally, without trying.

Understanding these passive abilities is crucial for players, as they define how characters inherently react and protect themselves in the game world, even without active efforts from the player.

| Ability Value | Passive Ability |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 0-19          | 0               |
| 20-39         | 1               |
| 40-59         | 2               |
| 60-79         | 3               |
| 80-99         | 4               |
| 100+          | 5               |

### Step 3: Life Points

Life points in RAW measure your character's physical and mental health. To find your life points, add 20 to the sum of your passive willpower and passive athletics values. This total shows how tough and resilient your character is.

Life points track the wellbeing of your character. If they drop to 0, your character dies. Falling below 10 life points means your character is seriously hurt. Challenges become harder, adding a 20-point penalty to all your rolls. This penalty reflects the struggle of pushing through pain and injury.
