RAW is a tabletop role-playing game designed with simplicity at its core. It simplifies traditional TTRPG mechanics by using a broad-strokes approach to abilities. Unlike games with extensive lists of skills, RAW condenses them into a few versatile abilities. This design lets players act decisively without getting bogged down in rules. For instance, a character skilled in melee can excel in both sword fighting and unarmed combat using the same ability score. This streamlined system keeps the focus on action and narrative progression.

This simplicity promotes a story-driven experience, where the game master uses flexibility and creativity to lead the game.

RAW encourages a story-driven approach, with the game master using common sense and fun to use the relevant abilities to resolve conflicts.

The system works for any setting, from fantasy to futuristic. Abilities adapt to the context; for example, "technology" might mean different things in different worlds. RAW is all about keeping things broad and flexible to enhance the story, rather than getting caught up in complex rules.
