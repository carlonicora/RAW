# RAW Roleplaying Game

RAW is a set of minimalist mechanics to run Role Playing Games. The mechanics are ability-based, meaning that resolution of challenges is based on a set of abilities that can grow over time. Character progression is measured in their growth in abilities, not levels. Abilities are coarse, so there is no difference between melee or brawl, nor between shooting with a bow or with a gun. The goal is to provide a simple and accessible rule-light framework that foster stories, and the game master should always apply common sense and a good dose of rule of cool.

The rules are designed to be age-agnostic, meaning they can be used to run a fantasy campaign as well as a contemporary, cyberpunk or space opera. The change is the meaning the game master give to the abilities. Technology, for example, would refer to the knowledge of how an aqueduct works in a fantasy world, but would identify the ability to hack into mainframes in a futuristic setting.

RAW's approach to coarse and polymorphic abilities is core to the approach to the game, where rules should facilitate the story, not vice versa.

## Game Mechanics

The game mechanics are based on abilities. They place the focus on which actions the player characters can perform. They also define its degree of success. They set the action resolution comparing an ability result to a threshold. The ability result is a character's ability level plus a roll of a dice.

Every ability value in RAW, as well as the thresholds, is based on a percentile scale between 0 and 100.

The mechanics define three types of actions: automatic, challenged and unchallenged.

### Automatic Actions

Rolling dice is cool, but to make it even more cool, it should be done sparingly, when the outcome of an action is meaningful. Lots of the things the characters do daily should not require a roll. A character with an ability of 40 should not be required to roll to do something trivial or simple. A roll should only be required when the threshold is higher than the ability value, and only if a success or a failure would be meaningful to move the story forward: make every roll count.

### Unchallenged Actions

Unchallenged actions are those a character do without being opposed by another character's action. In this category fall actions as ranged combat, investigation, driving and so on. The Game Master defines a threshold, and the player character should score more than the threshold by adding 1d20 to their ability value.

`action result = ability + 1d20`

### Challenged Actions

When a character wants to perform an action which another character can oppose with another skill, we have a challenged action. Examples of challenged actions are melee combat, persuasion vs willpower and so on.
In a challenged action, instead of comparing the action result to a threshold, we compare two action results: the action and the opposed action.

### Thresholds

In RAW, a generic thresholds level should be considered as such:

| Difficulty  | Threshold |
| ----------- | --------: |
| Trivial     |        20 |
| Simple      |        40 |
| Difficult   |        60 |
| Challenging |        80 |
| Extreme     |       100 |

### Degree of success

Succeeding in an action is rarely a yes/no result. In RAW, the result of an action identifies the degree of success or failure. The degree of success is a value that ranges from 1 to 6, where 1 is a minimal success while a 6 is a spectacular one. Every 20 points of difference between the threshold and the action result, the degree of success is raised by 1 point.

| Difference | Degree of Success |
| ---------- | ----------------: |
| 0-19       |                 1 |
| 20-39      |                 2 |
| 40-59      |                 3 |
| 60-79      |                 4 |
| 80-99      |                 5 |
| 100+       |                 6 |

The degree of success is the multiplier for any weapon damage.

### Critical Roll

Every time a natural 1 or a natural 20 are rolled, the roll is considered critical. A natural 1 will remove 20 points from the character ability value. A natural 20 will add 20 points to it.

| Ability Score | Roll | Total | Successes |
| ------------- | ---- | ----- | --------- |
| 35            | 10   | 45    | 2         |
| 35            | 1    | 15    | 0         |
| 35            | 20   | 75    | 3         |

### Combat

Combat is no different than any other action in RAW. Someone expert in melee can attack or parry if attacked. There is no initiative or rounds; players declare their actions and the actions are carried out in the order in which they are declared. If a single character wants to do multiple actions in comparison with other characters, excluding the first attack and the first parry/dodge, they will get a negative bonus of 20 for each additional action.

For example, if a character in a sword melee wants to attack two opponent and parry both their attacks, he will roll their abilities with this bonuses:
- first attack: no negative bonus
- first parry: no negative bonus
- second attack: -20
- second parry: -40

## Character Creation

There are two element of a character creation: boring numbers and exciting stories. The mechanics of the games help define a character through a series of stats which identifies each character's ability. Yet, the most important part in the creation of a character is their backstory and their personality.

### Abilities

In RAW, abilities are the cornerstone of the action resolution. Each character starts their journey with a total of 100 points to distribute amongst their abilities. A character can distribute the points in how many abilities they feel like.

Deciding how to distribute points is an art more than a science. Putting a few points in many abilities may generate a jack of all trades which is the master of none. On the other side picking only a handful of abilities with high values in each will generate strong character with lots of  weaknesses.

### Backstory

Role playing game is much more than numbers. While RAW focuses on game mechanics, it also recognises the importance of having well rounded characters. A character can thrive only when their player understands the story and the motives for the character to exists. These can be identified by telling how the character came to be. A simple way to write a backstory is to start from their abilities. By using those as blueprint to identify each character's past, it is easy to write a consistent backstory.

Please note we stand for storytelling, and Game Masters should rely on characters' backstory to create personal, intense adventures. While this is not easily measurable as a simple stat, we highly recommend to focus on this. Not only it will give Game Masters ways of making campaigns more interesting for the players; it will help players get in character much faster and with more intensity.

### Character motivations

One of the elements that help players to bond with their characters and give them three dimensional its is the definition of a motivation. In the grand scheme of life, what is the character's goal? The idea of an underlying motivation helps the player to manage the character better. It helps in the narrative and gives Game Masters hooks to use to make the game more fun.

### Life Points and Death

As in every roleplaying games, the rules surrounding death include elements as life points and when a character dies. RAW is no different, every character has 40 life points.

When a character loses all their life points due to damages, they die. An injured character can recover their life points either by resting, at the rate of 1 point per hour of rest, or with the help of medical abilities.

`life points = 40 + body`

When heavily damaged, characters have penalties to their actions.

| Remaining Life Points | Actions Penalty |
| --------------------- | --------------: |
| 10-20                 |              10 |
| 0-10                  |              20 |

## Character Progression

RAW consider characters' progression as a progression in their abilities, where their life points remains the same for the entire of the character's life. Characters become better at doing what they do, therefore they are allowed to grow after each played session.

The progression is extremely simple, and reflects the minimal approach used throughout these rules. Every session played, a character should receive 3 bonus points to try and update their abilities or learn new ones.

Players decide whichever ability to increase they like, without limiting them to those previously used. Character progression in RAW is the epitome of the "Rule of Cool": let players shape their characters how they love: everyone is going to have so much fun!

### Levelling up abilities

Once a character have bonus points available, the player can decide to try and increase the value of an ability. There are two ways of upgrading an ability: trying to level up quickly by rolling for it or simply adding one point to an ability for each bonus point spent.

The first method requires the player to roll higher than the current ability value on a 1d100. The ability will be increased by the amount of successes in the roll. A natural 100 would also duplicate the successes. While the levelling up is not automatic - the roll may fail - the character may also increase very quickly when their ability score is low.

| Ability Value | Roll | Successes |
| ------------- | ---- | --------- |
| 45            | 10   | 0         |
| 20            | 45   | 2         |
| 20            | 99   | 4         |
| 20            | 100  | 8         |

The second method, particularly effective when a character already has a high ability score, is to transform a bonus point in a skill point, increasing the ability by one point for each bonus used.

## Hero Points

Each character has a pool of points called "Hero Points", which are points that can change the tide of a contest or a fight, just because our characters are heroes. The pool can contain up to 100 points and these can be used as bonus during a roll.

Let's say your character wants to crack the clues, and you get a total of 57. Two successes! But with just 3 more points you can get three successes, making it easier to solve the puzzle. Or what if your character is trying to deal a final blow to the dragon. Your attack score is 75, and theirs parry is 87? You know you can kill the dragon now. Spending 12 her points you hit, but spending 32 you may deal more damage, finally getting rid of the creature forever.

The idea behind the hero points is to provide the players more agency in the narrative structure. The players should identify moments in the game where succeeding in something is important to them, and having hero points allow it.

### Hero Point Replenishment

The Hero Points might have a chance to be replenished at the beginning of every session. Similar to how you can increase your abilities with bonus points, every session you can try and replenish your pool of hero points by rolling a d100 and adding the successes to the pool.

### Inspiration

Another important source of hero points replenishment is inspirations. Inspirations are tokens that are awarded to players for doing something amazing. Intense roleplay scenes, fantastic characterisation, heroic actions... everything that makes the game better.

Everyone can propose an inspiration award, and the Game Master should encourage players to reward each other; however, while everyone should propose an inspiration award, only the Game Master is allowed to award it.

Every time a player receives an inspiration token, their hero points pool is increased by 3 hero points.

The Game Masters should use the inspiration as tool to create more cohesiveness to the party, creating a way for players to support each other in creating a better game.

### Donations

Players can also decide to donate some of their hero points to another character, for a spectacular success. In order to do so, the Game Masters should ask the donor to explain why they are doing it and how this identifies visually. Maybe the character is helping another, or when the sword is ready to strike, it's that hope that is shared. The Game Master should make the donation of Hero Points a true moment of party unity.
