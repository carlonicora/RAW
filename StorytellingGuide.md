# Storytelling Guide

This guide will give you the tools to plot, write and run campaigns your player will want to play.

## Introduction

### Disclaimers

This is one of the many ways of running a tabletop role playing game and identifies my own view. This is based on years of experience, lots of failures and pretty strong ideas. I hope you like the opportunity to plot and develop a story with your players, but never be afraid to try new things.

### Your role in a tabletop role playing game

One of the things you should keep in mind is your role in a tabletop role playing game. You are the plotter and the enabler, you are not the sole writer. Your mindset should always be to listen to your players and adapt your games depending on the player characters' choices. Make sure you read your players, what they want and what they want to experience, and use the multitude of information and guessworks they will produce to impact the future of your campaigns.

### Railroading or open worlds? Plots

In the endless discussions between supporters of strict campaign structures and open worlds, this guide stands in the middle. I advocate for flexible plots, that identify the overarching ideas behind a campaign, but that are never written in stone. Both Railroading and Open Worlds have problems, the first feels like reading a book and the second feels like wandering without a purpose. Plotting, in my book, means preparing a compelling idea your players want to play.

### The right players for the right storyteller

Everything I write stems from one important concept: some players wants some specific type of storytelling. You should know your players and they should know you. There is nothing wrong admitting that, sometimes, a group is not a match made in heaven. As a storyteller it is your role to make sure you play with players who love your style of storytelling.

### Goes without saying

Nobody wins of loses in a tabletop role playing game. If you think you can write a story to win over your players, I pity you. If your players love to be "min-maxers", I pity them.

A role playing game is a collaborative effort to enjoy the time we have.

### The examples in this Guide

In this guide I will give you examples of how I write my stories. The examples will follow the story of *Kith-shan*, an ex Jedi Padawan who survived Order 66, and it is now going around the Empire-dominated galaxy trying to survive and find his place.

```
Example

You survived Order 66, but that came at a cost. All your friends were slaughtered, and your master perished in order to save your life. This was 5 years ago, 5 long years in which you have lost your path, in which you have forgotten what it means to be a Jedi, so busy trying to hide yourself and silence your inner dialogs and demons.
```

## Writing structures

This Storytelling Guide will use two writing structures: [AND](#and) and [Story Circle](#story-circle). They are very similar in the way they see a story arc, but I use them differently depending on the level of details I need. With some groups, I tend to write very little as they are extremely proactive, with others I plot much more.

Both the writing structures I will briefly present below focus on one thing: problem solving and overcoming the odds. Introducing difficulties in your plots and allowing your player characters to solve them is the key to an enjoyable campaign.

### AND

The AND story structure is a way of telling a story in four simple parts:

- a need
- the first attempt to fulfil the need
- a challenge
- a resolution

```
I need something
AND I try to get it
BUT there is an unexpected issue in the process
THEREFORE I need to change the way I am to fulfil my need
```

This wave of need/try/fail/succeed is the perfect structure to keep high the interest in your players.

```
Example of an AND Adventure Plot

After arriving on Tatooine in search for a Jedi Master who is rumoured to hide in the desolate planet, Kith-shan sees her contact being killed in front of her eyes.
AND decides to investigate the reasons behind the murder
BUT when she finds the Tusken Raider who killed her, she realises her connection with the Force has weakened
THEREFORE she fights the Tusken Raider without the Force and learns that the rumours are true: there is a Force User in the Dune Sea of Tatooine.
```

In the short example above, you can see that there is tension. The Fedi Padawan needs something (talking to an old contact, finding a master, understanding why her contact was killed) and goes through some hurdles to get to something tangible. But she fails in the middle, there is a moment of despair when she can't use the Force as she was used to, but she resorts to changing her life, and is rewarded with the thing she dreams the most: finding a Jedi Master.

Where do I use the AND structure? I use it to draft my initial campaign plot, each adventure structure and each session structure. The goal is to simplify the creation of a story in a few lines. The challenge is to learn to do it in such a way you give yourself ample space to expand your structure to contain interesting things for the player characters to do.

### Story Circle

The story circle is a distillation of The hero of a Thousand Faces story structure. Instead of 17 complicated steps, the story circle divides each story in eight points, divided in 4 simple groups. I have adapted the typical story circle to work well in plotting a tabletop role playing game.

1. **You**: An introduction to the player character's normal life.
2. **Need**: Make the player characters feel the need to do something, to embark in the adventure.
3. **Go**: Decide to go and move the first steps to fulfil their need.
4. **Search**: Overcome the odds (*the path of trials*)
5. **Find**: Find what the player characters were looking for...
6. **Take**: ///but make them pay a huge price for it and give them a different goal
7. **Return**: Make the player characters decide to stop moaning and reach for the stars. They come back to the world they know
8. **Change**: And they change themselves, therefore changing the world they know (*aka, they succeed*)

The Story Circle is, first and foremost a circle. Every story is the continuation of the previous one and changes the player characters for the next one.

The eight steps are grouped in four different stages:

1. **Introduction**: (*You* + *Need*) the player characters feel the need to follow your plot.
2. **First Attempt**: (*Go* + *Search*) AND they try to fulfil their needs.
3. **Failure**: (*Find* + *Take*) BUT they fail, in a way, and realise the real fulfilment comes from something else
4. **Success**: (*Return* + *Change*) THEREFORE they overcome the challenge and become new characters through their experience

As you can see the groups of the story circle are practically the same as the four steps of the [AND](#and) method. This is why I use both: I start with the [AND](#and) and then I detail it with the [Story Circle](#story-circle).


```
Example of a Story Circle Adventure Plot

- You: Kith-shan arrives on Tatooine looking or a Jedi Master who is rumoured to be on the planet.
- Need: She must speak to her contact, but she witness her murdered by a Tusken Raider and gets the impression the Raider was waiting for her to arrive before killing her contact. She feels that her only hope of finding the Jedi Master is running away.
- Go: Kith-shan starts running behind the Raider and dodges a few groups of Stormtroopers
- Search: She manage to see that the Tusken Raider is moving towards a specific part of the Dune Sea and recovers something they dropped by mistake: parts of a lightsaber.
- Find: Kith-shan finds the Tusken Raiders' camp and realises that they have Jedi relics, but realises her connection with the Force is much weaker than she thought.
- Take: She identifies the killer, but fails to acquire any additional knowledge about the rumoured Jedi Master. At the lowest point, tired and dehydrated, she receives a vision of her old Master, who tells her that patience and perseverance wins over every hurdle.
- Return: Kith-shan, sees the killer moving away from the camp, and manages to fight and defeat him.
- Change: She finds a holo message in the Raider's pocket of a shadowy figure that tells them Kith-shan was coming on Tatooine, ordering them to kill her and make her disappear in the Dune Sea before investigating the rumours of a Jedi in a specific part of the Dune Sea.
```

As you can see, the Story Circle allows me to go much more in the adventure's details. Yet, when I write it, I always start from its simplified version: the [AND](#and) writing structure.

### Differences between the plot and the actual game

As you have noticed, I write my plots as if they were stories. This is my original idea, the plot that helps me explode a [campaign](#campaign) in multiple [adventures](#adventure), an [adventure](#adventure) in multiple [sessions](#session), and a [session](#session) in multiple [scenes](#scene). I do this to have an idea of the things I *plan* to happen; however, the game and my players' choices define the actual game. My plot may well be ended ten minutes in the first [session](#session) because the player characters decide not to feel the need to do something, or just because they'd rather do something else.

A plot is a blueprint of what may happen. If the players are interested in the story I am presenting to them, they will highly likely follow the story, and my plot will become the story. Some other times they won't find what I set in front of their characters compelling enough, and they will do other things.

As a Storyteller, it is your role to plan, prepare and be ready to improvise to give your players the adventure they want, not the one you wrote.

### Stop calling the "Adventure Hook"

One of the things I am very vocal about is the "adventure hook". You know, the player characters are in a tavern and someone offers them a reward if they do something. That falls absolutely flat, and offers your player characters the option to say: "*nope, not interested, thanks*"; however, if you replace the word "*hook*" with the words "*feel the need*", than you can drive the player characters to your plot without railroading their choices.

To make this work, you must know your players and their characters well. Their mindset, their desires and fears, and leverage those to create a world they would love to explore.

Consider the two examples below.

```
Example of Adventure Hook

You reached Mos Eisley, and in the cantina you notice that everyone casts suspicious looks at you. One of the bartenders gets close and says:
- I am sorry, but we had lots of troubles with foreigners, you know... lots of people gets mugged.
He eyes your lightsabers
- People are scared here, but seeing your kind, would you be interested in going to the dune sea and look for a Tusken Raider who is causing all these troubles? We can pay for it.
```

It's *blah*. Probably the player characters had other things in their mind, and they can easily refuse, destroying your adventure hook.

```
Example of Need

As you get into the cantina, you look around. There's an old acquaintance of yours, one of those lovely scoundrels whom you had the pleasure (and displeasure as well) to deal with in the past. As soon as you move your first steps, you notice she looks frightened, nervously eyeing a Tusken Rider sitting at her side.

At a moment notice the Raider, after having seen you, takes their blaster our and shoots her, creating a massive panic. The Raider seemed to look at you as if they knew you, as if this was planned and this was a message for you. As soon as the crowd disperses, most of whom just decided to drop on the ground, you see the Raider getting out from the back door, leaving the corpse of your friend to the ground.

"Run, they will come back for us", you hear people screaming

"It's 'them'", other are whispering, looking at you, clearly out of context in the shoddy cantina.

"We don't want your 'kind'" the bartender says, while looking at you.

"Imperials are coming!" shouts someone trying to find a place where to become invisible to the Stormtroopers on their way to the cantina.
```

A person you knew was murdered in front of your eyes, and you don't know much about it. Considering you are a Jedi Padawan, it's highly likely you won't just turn around and leave. I don't even need to offer you a reward to run behind the Tusken Raider, I gave you a solid reason for you to do it. You need to stop them and understand why the Tusken Raider seemed to be waiting for you before killing your contact.

Of course, not all the "Needs" you write will have an effect, but the more you practice, the more you will understand your players and how to place a juicy piece of meat they can't refuse.

### Different moments, different speed

In the 4 moments of both the [AND](#and) structure and the [Story Circle][#story-circle] you should consider the speed and intensity of the game. In the same way a story made only of plain things to do (*you do this AND this AND then you do this AND then something else...*), the writing structures presented above give you the possibility to give your campaign a different tempo.

In the *introduction* the game will be slow and static. You need to work hard on making sure your players commit to your story, they have to feel the need to do something.

In the *first attempt* they will have to step in the unknown, feel the pressure and try their best to solve something. It is going to be faster than before, more actions, more thrill.

In the *failure* they will feel the weight of having reached something, just to pay a huge price for it. They need to regroup from the lower moment in the adventure, and decide what to do.

In the *Succeed* part they feel the elation of understanding how to change and overcome bigger things. The player characters must feel they are becoming better characters, stronger and with more information.

## The Anatomy of plotting a story

I am a structured person. I find that organising a game in a clear and repeatable way gives me the possibility to keep consistency in the campaign. This is why I structure my campaigns quite tightly (*at least in the beginning*). Of course, I know that the campaign plot will change, the structure of my adventures will adapt to my player's decision.

I structure the campaign to have four main parts (*I am sure you can guess them*)
- Introduction
- Fist Attempt
- First Failure
- Success

And I plot two adventures for each part (*I am sure you can guess them as well*)
- You
- Need
- Go
- Search
- Find
- Take
- Return
- Change

Each Adventure is divided in four sessions (*Introduction*, *Fist Attempt*, *First Failure*, *Success*). Each adventure is self-contained, but I link one to another to create a story continuity.

Each Session is divided in eight or sixteen scenes (one or two for each part of the Story Circle).

In the next part, I will explain how I plot everyone of these structures, to make sure I never run out of ideas.

### Campaign

#### Make it personal

What I always ask my players to write is a character background, their quirks and the important moments in their story. I want the players to be committed to their characters and their stories. I want them to care about more than just stats. This has two implications: the first is that they will connect with their characters, the second is that they will give me a story I can use in the campaign.

For each character I plan a "Backstory Adventure" that digs into one of the player characters at the time. I make it personal, I explore each character's dreams and goals and I give them the possibility to achieve them. These adventures become part of my campaign structure, and I tend to place them in between the changes of tone in the campaign.

### Adventure

### Session

### Scene

A scene is, first and foremost, a moment in which the player characters must **do** something. A scene must prepare an action the player characters should do. Without an action, the scene is just a story, which after a while becomes boring.

## World Building

### Non-Player Characters

### Factions

### Locations

### Events
