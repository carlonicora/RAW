# Storytelling Guide

This guide will give you the tools to plot, write and run campaigns your player will want to play.

## Introduction

### Disclaimers

This is one of the many ways of running a tabletop role playing game and identifies my own view. This is based on years of experience, lots of failures and pretty strong ideas. I hope you like the opportunity to plot and develop a story with your players, but never be afraid to try new things.

### Your role in a tabletop role playing game

One of the things you should keep in mind is your role in a tabletop role playing game. You are the plotter and the enabler, you are not the sole writer. Your mindset should always be to listen to your players and adapt your games depending on the player characters' choices. Make sure you read your players, what they want and what they want to experience, and use the multitude of information and guessworks they will produce to impact the future of your campaigns.

### Railroading or open worlds? Plots

In the endless discussions between supporters of strict campaign structures and open worlds, this guide stands in the middle. I advocate for flexible plots, that identify the overarching ideas behind a campaign, but that are never written in stone. Both Railroading and Open Worlds have problems, the first feels like reading a book and the second feels like wandering without a purpose. Plotting, in my book, means preparing a compelling idea your players want to play.

### The right players for the right storyteller

Everything I write stems from one important concept: some players wants some specific type of storytelling. You should know your players and they should know you. There is nothing wrong admitting that, sometimes, a group is not a match made in heaven. As a storyteller it is your role to make sure you play with players who love your style of storytelling.

### Goes without saying

Nobody wins of loses in a tabletop role playing game. If you think you can write a story to win over your players, I pity you. If your players love to be "min-maxers", I pity them.

A role playing game is a collaborative effort to enjoy the time we have.

### The examples in this Guide

In this guide I will give you examples of how I write my stories. The examples will follow the story of *Kith-shan*, an ex Jedi Padawan who survived Order 66, and it is now going around the Empire-dominated galaxy trying to survive and find his place.

> **Example**
>
> You survived Order 66, but that came at a cost. All your friends were slaughtered, and your master perished in order to save your life. This was 5 years ago, 5 long years in which you have lost your path, in which you have forgotten what it means to be a Jedi, so busy trying to hide yourself and silence your inner dialogs and demons.

## Writing structures

This Storytelling Guide will use two writing structures: [ABT](#abt) and [Story Circle](#story-circle). They are very similar in the way they see a story arc, but I use them differently depending on the level of details I need. With some groups, I tend to write very little as they are extremely proactive, with others I plot much more.

Both the writing structures I will briefly present below focus on one thing: problem solving and overcoming the odds. Introducing difficulties in your plots and allowing your player characters to solve them is the key to an enjoyable campaign.

### ABT

The ABT story structure is a way of telling a story in four simple parts:

- a need
- (**A**nd) the first attempt to fulfil the need
- (**B**ut) a challenge
- (**T**herefore) a resolution

> I need something
>
> **AND** I try to get it
>
> **BUT** there is an unexpected issue in the process
>
> **THEREFORE** I need to change the way I am to fulfil my need

This wave of need/try/fail/succeed is the perfect structure to keep high the interest in your players.

> **Example of an ABT Adventure Plot**
>
> After arriving on Tatooine in search for a Jedi Master who is rumoured to hide in the desolate planet, Kith-shan sees her contact being killed in front of her eyes.
>
> **AND** decides to investigate the reasons behind the murder
>
> **BUT** when she finds the Tusken Raider who killed her, she realises her connection with the Force has weakened
>
> **THEREFORE** she fights the Tusken Raider without the Force and learns that the rumours are true: there is a Force User in the Dune Sea of Tatooine.


In the short example above, you can see that there is tension. The Jedi Padawan needs something (talking to an old contact, finding a master, understanding why her contact was killed) and goes through some hurdles to get to something tangible. But she fails in the middle, there is a moment of despair when she can't use the Force as she was used to, but she resorts to changing her life, and is rewarded with the thing she dreams the most: finding a Jedi Master.

Where do I use the ABT structure? I use it to draft my initial campaign plot, each adventure structure and each session structure. The goal is to simplify the creation of a story in a few lines. The challenge is to learn to do it in such a way you give yourself ample space to expand your structure to contain interesting things for the player characters to do.

### Story Circle

The story circle is a distillation of The hero of a Thousand Faces story structure. Instead of 17 complicated steps, the story circle divides each story in eight points, divided in 4 simple groups. I have adapted the typical story circle to work well in plotting a tabletop role playing game.

1. **You**: An introduction to the player character's normal life.
2. **Need**: Make the player characters feel the need to do something, to embark in the adventure.
3. **Go**: Decide to go and move the first steps to fulfil their need.
4. **Search**: Overcome the odds (*the path of trials*)
5. **Find**: Find what the player characters were looking for...
6. **Take**: ///but make them pay a huge price for it and give them a different goal
7. **Return**: Make the player characters decide to stop moaning and reach for the stars. They come back to the world they know
8. **Change**: And they change themselves, therefore changing the world they know (*aka, they succeed*)

The Story Circle is, first and foremost a circle. Every story is the continuation of the previous one and changes the player characters for the next one.

The eight steps are grouped in four different stages:

1. **Introduction**: (*You* + *Need*) the player characters feel the need to follow your plot.
2. **First Attempt**: (*Go* + *Search*) AND they try to fulfil their needs.
3. **Failure**: (*Find* + *Take*) BUT they fail, in a way, and realise the real fulfilment comes from something else
4. **Success**: (*Return* + *Change*) THEREFORE they overcome the challenge and become new characters through their experience

As you can see the groups of the story circle are practically the same as the four steps of the [ABT](#abt) method. This is why I use both: I start with the [ABT](#abt) and then I detail it with the [Story Circle](#story-circle).

> **Example of a Story Circle Adventure Plot**
> - **You**: Kith-shan arrives on Tatooine looking or a Jedi Master who is
rumoured to be on the planet. and if I write something long?
> - **Need**: She must speak to her contact, but she witness her murdered by a Tusken Raider and gets the impression the Raider was waiting for her to arrive before killing her contact. She feels that her only hope of finding the Jedi Master is running away.
> - **Go**: Kith-shan starts running behind the Raider and dodges a few groups of Stormtroopers
> - **Search**: She manage to see that the Tusken Raider is moving towards a specific part of the Dune Sea and recovers something they dropped by mistake: parts of a lightsaber.
> - **Find**: Kith-shan finds the Tusken Raiders' camp and realises that they have Jedi relics, but realises her connection with the Force is much weaker than she thought.
> - **Take**: She identifies the killer, but fails to acquire any additional knowledge about the rumoured Jedi Master. At the lowest point, tired and dehydrated, she receives a vision of her old Master, who tells her that patience and perseverance wins over every hurdle.
> - **Return**: Kith-shan, sees the killer moving away from the camp, and manages to fight and defeat him.
> - **Change**: She finds a holo message in the Raider's pocket of a shadowy figure that tells them Kith-shan was coming on Tatooine, ordering them to kill her and make her disappear in the Dune Sea before investigating the rumours of a Jedi in a specific part of the Dune Sea.

As you can see, the Story Circle allows me to go much more in the adventure's details. Yet, when I write it, I always start from its simplified version: the [ABT](#abt) writing structure.

### Differences between the plot and the actual game

As you have noticed, I write my plots as if they were stories. This is my original idea, the plot that helps me explode a [campaign](#campaign) in multiple [adventures](#adventure), an [adventure](#adventure) in multiple [sessions](#session), and a [session](#session) in multiple [scenes](#scene). I do this to have an idea of the things I *plan* to happen; however, the game and my players' choices define the actual game. My plot may well be ended ten minutes in the first [session](#session) because the player characters decide not to feel the need to do something, or just because they'd rather do something else.

A plot is a blueprint of what may happen. If the players are interested in the story I am presenting to them, they will highly likely follow the story, and my plot will become the story. Some other times they won't find what I set in front of their characters compelling enough, and they will do other things.

As a Storyteller, it is your role to plan, prepare and be ready to improvise to give your players the adventure they want, not the one you wrote.

### Stop calling the "Adventure Hook"

One of the things I am very vocal about is the "adventure hook". You know, the player characters are in a tavern and someone offers them a reward if they do something. That falls absolutely flat, and offers your player characters the option to say: "*nope, not interested, thanks*"; however, if you replace the word "*hook*" with the words "*feel the need*", than you can drive the player characters to your plot without railroading their choices.

To make this work, you must know your players and their characters well. Their mindset, their desires and fears, and leverage those to create a world they would love to explore.

Consider the two examples below.

> **Example of Adventure Hook**
>
> You reached Mos Eisley, and in the cantina you notice that everyone casts suspicious looks at you. One of the bartenders gets close and says:
>
> "*I am sorry, but we had lots of troubles with foreigners, you know... lots of people gets mugged.*"
>
> He eyes your lightsabers
>
> "*People are scared here, but seeing your kind, would you be interested in going to the dune sea and look for a Tusken Raider who is causing all these troubles? We can pay for it.*"

It's *blah*. Probably the player characters had other things in their mind, and they can easily refuse, destroying your adventure hook.

> **Example of a Need**
>
> As you get into the cantina, you look around. There's an old acquaintance of yours, one of those lovely scoundrels whom you had the pleasure (and displeasure as well) to deal with in the past. As soon as you move your first steps, you notice she looks frightened, nervously eyeing a Tusken Rider sitting at her side.
>
>At a moment notice the Raider, after having seen you, takes their blaster our and shoots her, creating a massive panic. The Raider seemed to look at you as if they knew you, as if this was planned and this was a message for you. As soon as the crowd disperses, most of whom just decided to drop on the ground, you see the Raider getting out from the back door, leaving the corpse of your friend to the ground.
>
> "*Run, they will come back for us*", you hear people screaming
>
> "*It's 'them'*", other are whispering, looking at you, clearly out of context in the shoddy cantina.
>
> "*We don't want your 'kind'*" the bartender says, while looking at you.
>
> "*Imperials are coming!*" shouts someone trying to find a place where to become invisible to the Stormtroopers on their way to the cantina.
>
> **What do you do?**

A person you knew was murdered in front of your eyes, and you don't know much about it. Considering you are a Jedi Padawan, it's highly likely you won't just turn around and leave. I don't even need to offer you a reward to run behind the Tusken Raider, I gave you a solid reason for you to do it. You need to stop them and understand why the Tusken Raider seemed to be waiting for you before killing your contact.

Of course, not all the "Needs" you write will have an effect, but the more you practice, the more you will understand your players and how to place a juicy piece of meat they can't refuse.

### Different moments, different speed

In the 4 moments of both the [ABT](#abt) structure and the [Story Circle][#story-circle] you should consider the speed and intensity of the game. In the same way a story made only of plain things to do (*you do this AND this AND then you do this AND then something else...*), the writing structures presented above give you the possibility to give your campaign a different tempo.

In the *introduction* the game will be slow and static. You need to work hard on making sure your players commit to your story, they have to feel the need to do something.

In the *first attempt* they will have to step in the unknown, feel the pressure and try their best to solve something. It is going to be faster than before, more actions, more thrill.

In the *failure* they will feel the weight of having reached something, just to pay a huge price for it. They need to regroup from the lower moment in the adventure, and decide what to do.

In the *Succeed* part they feel the elation of understanding how to change and overcome bigger things. The player characters must feel they are becoming better characters, stronger and with more information.

## The Anatomy of plotting a story

I am a structured person. I find that organising a game in a clear and repeatable way gives me the possibility to keep consistency in the campaign. This is why I structure my campaigns quite tightly (*at least in the beginning*). Of course, I know that the campaign plot will change, the structure of my adventures will adapt to my player's decision.

I structure the campaign to have four main parts (*I am sure you can guess them*)
- Introduction
- Fist Attempt
- First Failure
- Success

And I plot two adventures for each part (*I am sure you can guess them as well*)
- You
- Need
- Go
- Search
- Find
- Take
- Return
- Change

Each Adventure is divided in four sessions (*Introduction*, *Fist Attempt*, *First Failure*, *Success*). Each adventure is self-contained, but I link one to another to create a story continuity.

Each Session is divided in eight or sixteen scenes (one or two for each part of the Story Circle).

In the next part, I will explain how I plot everyone of these structures, to make sure I never run out of ideas.

### Campaign

Writing a campaign plot should be two-stage process: the first is the [ABT campaign plot](#abt-campaign-plot) and [world building](#world-building), the second is the [Story Circle campaign plot](#story-circle-campaign-plot).

In the first part you should focus on writing a very simple [ABT campaign plot](#abt-campaign-plot) **without** the player characters in mind. The goal is to put a frame of reference on the world and its events. These are the events with which the player characters will interact. The process that starts with the simple [ABT campaign plot](#abt-campaign-plot) and should expand into a process of [world building](#world-building).

The second is the [Story Circle campaign plot](#story-circle-campaign-plot), which details how the player characters will interact with the plot and the world written in the first part.

#### ABT Campaign Plot

It is important to spend as much time as needed on making sure the [ABT](#abt) campaign plot and the [world building](#world-building) is an extensive overview of what the player characters may encounter. The [world building](#world-building) exercise should come after having written the [ABT](#abt) campaign plot and should expand the stories around the main non-player characters.


> **Example of an ABT campaign plot**
>
> The spirit of Exar-Kun has awakened on Yavin 4, willing to reconquer the galaxy
>
> **AND** he hunts to possess a body powerful enough to support him
>
> **BUT** the Emperor feels his presence and sends Darth Vader to eliminate him
>
> **THEREFORE** Exar-Kun must accept some allies to overpower the Siths and rule the galaxy

As you can see in the example above, there is absolutely no mention of the player characters or how they are going to interact with the campaign plot. In here, I have decided to use examples from the Star Wars Canon and Legend lore, but you can use anything that pops in your mind, as long as it follows a non-player character story arc.

From here, you should start [world building](#world-building) to solidify your idea into a plot that makes sense.

### Story Circle Campaign Plot

Now that your [ABT campaign plot](#abt-campaign-plot) is written and you have done a solid exercise in [world building](#world-building), it is time to bring your player characters in the mist of it. At this point you should have an idea of what your players would like to play. Following my previous example, I will consider a party of Force Sensitive characters.

The [Story Circle](#story-circle) campaign plot should intertwine with the [ABT campaign plot](#abt-campaign-plot) so to match the stages of the two. The way you should write it is simple: follow the [Story Circle](#story-circle) writing structure to plot a series of 8 adventures. These adventures are going to change: the way your players will react to the campaign will make you go back and forth, but having a solid idea plays dividends in the long run.

- **You**: Introduction to the player characters and their struggles
- **Need**: Bring the main needs of the player characters on the surface and make them felt
- **Go**: Allow the player characters an adventure to organise themselves
- **Search**: First attempt at fulfilling their needs
- **Find**: Let the player character reach what they believed was the solution, but hit them hard with the consequences
- **Take**: Fallout of the consequences and realisation that they need to change
- **Return**: The player characters take their lives in their hands and return a world they can control
- **Change**: Big showdown, series finale, the player characters have the possibility to win and fulfil their lives

Always remember to link the [ABT non-player character-focussed campaign plot](#abt-campaign-plot) with the long form [Story Circle](#story-circle) player character-focussed one.

> **Example of Story Circle campaign plot**
>
> - **You**: "*The band of rebels*".
> The player characters come together and realise they all have something in common: they are all Force Users.
> - **Need**: "*The power is nothing without control*"
> The player characters face the first trouble and they realise they must find someone who can train them in the ways of the Force.
> - **Go**: "*The hunt for a master*"
> The player characters start looking for a Jedi Master which can help them learn, and they discover rumours of one on Tatooine, but finding them proves challenging.
> - **Search**: "*The path of the Force*"
> The player characters have found a Jedi Master, and need to improve their skills. They end up on Yavin 4, where they are tempted by a still-weak spirit of Exar-Kun.
> - **Find**: "*The secret weapon of the Empire*"
> The player characters go to Ilum to acquire the Kyber crystals for their lightsaber,but find that the Empire is collecting Kyber crystal for a super weapon.
> - **Take**: "*Exar-Kun*"
> The player character should come in contact with Exar-Kun, who will possess their Jedi Master's body.
> - **Return**: "*Between the hammer and the anvil*"
> The player characters will find themselves between Exar-Kun and the Empire, but they will be skilled enough to be able to play a part in the upcoming finale.
> - **Change**: "*The lesser of two evils or no evils?*"
> The player characters will come to the conclusion of the campaign. They are no longer Force sensitive, they are Jedi, and they can change the face of the Galaxy in the big showdown.

What you are writing here is not the [Adventure](#adventure) plot. You don't need to add too many details to the adventure ideas. You should only focus on the [Story Circle](#story-circle) plot of the campaign. Every other details, especially those regarding the later adventures, should remain just a guideline.

Notice how the first few adventures are very much unlinked from the [ABT campaign plot](#abt-campaign-plot), and serve as giving them the time to grow as characters. The first adventures are still in the same world, and the player characters should be exposed to elements of the [ABT campaign plot](#abt-campaign-plot). For example, having a close encounter with the spirit of Exar-Kun, or be on Yavin 4 where they can feel the Force being strong. All these details are important, as they will close the circle in many "*a-ha moments*" players love.

What would happen if the players decide to do the unexpected? You should change your plot to match the players decision. For example, if in their third adventure, the player characters decide to give in to the Dark Side and join Exar-Kun in his quest to destroy the Empire? Simple, you can rewrite your adventures to match the new direction the players want.

You should consider that a campaign like the one in the example above, including two to three [background adventures](#make-the-campaign-personal-to-your-player-characters) should last at least 40 sessions, which should mean an entire year of weekly games. Often you will find yourself in the position of adding more [adventures](#adventure) to better shape the world around the player characters.

#### Make the campaign personal to your player characters

I always ask my players to write a character background, their quirks and the important moments in their story. I want the players to be committed to their characters and their stories. I want them to care about more than just stats. This has two implications: the first is that they will connect with their characters, the second is that they will give me a story I can use in the campaign.

For each character I plan a "Backstory Adventure" that digs into one of the player characters at the time. I make it personal, I explore each character's dreams and goals and I give them the possibility to achieve them. These adventures become part of my campaign structure, and I tend to place them in between the changes of tone in the campaign.

### Adventure

Once the [Campaign](#campaign) plot is ready and makes sense, it is time to start plotting adventures. You should have at least [eight ideas](#story-circle-campaign-plot) to work on, and have an entire [world](#world-building) full of details at your disposal. But how to write an adventure plot? And most importantly: when to write it?

For my adventures, I rely exclusively on the [ABT](#abt) writing structure. An adventure is a collection of [Sessions](#session), which means that most of the details will go into the latter part. The adventure plot is a blueprint you write to make sure your next sessions are cohesive and have a start and an end.

The key point is: when should you write an adventure? For me there is only one moment when you can do it: when the previous adventure is over. The adventure plot is very much an overview of what the player are going to face in the next month or two, so you don't want to plan so much in advance, as the players' decision may derail your plan. When that happens, you either have to rewrite the entire adventure plot, of you plough through with your original idea, railroading the campaign. Neither is good.

The plot for the adventures is a simple [ABT](#abt) plot.

- Need
- (**A**nd) First Attempt
- (**B**ut) First Failure
- (**T**herefore) Success

To simplify my job, I copy the short adventure description I have written in my [Story Circle campaign plot](#story-circle-campaign-plot).

> **Example of an ABT Adventure Plot (Adventure 4 in the Campaign plot)**
>
> *(Adventure idea: The player characters have found a Jedi Master, and need to improve their skills. They end up on Yavin 4, where they are tempted by a still-weak spirit of Exar-Kun.)*
>
> - After having found a Jedi Master, Kith-shan realises that Tatooine is not a
safe place where to live and be trained
> - **AND** finds out about a moon around the giant Yavin 4 with old abandoned temples that are perfect for being trained
> - **BUT** when they start training on Yavin 4, they start perceiving the Dark Side of the force to be very strong, and a presence that is trying to tempt them to the dark side
> - **THEREFORE** they have to fight back the evil spirit and remain in the Light Side

The more you move from writing a [campaigns](#campaign) plot down to [adventures](#adventure), [sessions](#session) and [scenes](#scene), the more you will add details. The overarching plot of the campaign starts becoming more and more detailed and comes to detailed life the more you go one level lower. You have to make sure that before you start writing a plot, you check where that specific plot lives, so you can reuse as many already written ideas.

You will also notice that using an [ABT](#abt) writing structure in the [adventures](#adventure) plot will help you writing the sessions. Four [sessions](#session) per adventure means that every [session](#session) will refer to a sentence in your [ABT](#abt) adventure plot.

### Session

Writing a session plot comes with a note: every storyteller is different and every tabletop role playing game group is different. I tend to over-write my sessions, because in my investigative style it gives me the possibility to present clues in a consistent way. There is no right or wrong though.

For me, the best approach is to write a simple [ABT](#abt) session plot and then expand it to a [Story Circle](#story-circle) one. This allows me to have more clarity for when it comes to writing the scenes. It helps me to create an overview that I will then details, as I find it easier to start from the generic and dig deeper into the specifics. It also comes easy to write the scenes once I know what is an ideal timeline of the session.

Remember: all this writing and plotting can easily be thrown out of the window if your players decide to do things you had not anticipated. For how much you know the players and their characters, you should expect (and even welcome) when they derail your plot to build the story themselves. In such case, having a clear plot will help you improvising, as you will know the world inside-out thanks to your [world building](#world-building).

As for the [adventures](#adventure) there is a right moment to plot a session, and it is when the previous session is played. There are so many moving parts in a tabletop role playing game, that the change in one small detail have the power to change the entire universe. Be ready to embrace the changes your players do to your plot, and use them to enhance your ideas. They will soon start joking that you take their ideas and use them, so they will be careful in saying anything, but secretly every player loves when the storyteller takes their ideas and plunge them in the game.

> **Example of an ABT Session plot (Session 3 -BUT- in the Adventure Plot)**
>
> *(Session Idea: BUT when they start training on Yavin 4, they start perceiving the Dark Side of the force to be very strong, and a presence that is trying to tempt them to the dark side)*
> - Kith-shan is intensely training under the supervision of his Master and needs to reach the top of the temple to prove her ability in the Force
> - **AND** she trains and runs blindfolded through the temple until she reaches some sealed doors she can only open through the Force
> - **BUT** in the throne room, she feels a presence (Exar-Kun) who appears as a ghost and talks to her. It tells her to be the spirit of a long-deceased Jedi, asking to be helped to find its resting place in the galaxy
> - **THEREFORE** she needs to decide how to treat the presence while she will be tempted to help the presence to find its resting place in the galaxy.

In this [ABT](#abt) session plot, which should be played in a single session of 3/4 hours, the Storyteller should be able to start filling the player characters' time with lots of things to do, choices to make and secrets to investigate and discover. This is the reason why the [ABT](#abt) writing structure alone is not enough to detail what the player characters will face (granted you have time to write more, which I normally do).

To help comes the use of the [Story Circle](#story-circle) writing structure, which stems from the [ABT](#abt) session plot you have just written.

> **Example of a Story Circle Session plot (Session 3 -BUT- in the Adventure Plot)**
>
> *(Kith-shan is intensely training under the supervision of his Master)*
> - **You**: Kith-shan is at the base of the old temple and preparing for the daily training with her Master.
> - **Need**: Her Master tells her she should run through the temple blindfolded, allowing only the Force and her other senses to show her the way to the throne room, which is on the top of the temple itself.
>
> *(AND she trains and runs blindfolded through the temple until she reaches some sealed doors she can only open through the Force)*
> - **Go**: Kith-shan starts concentrating and after some time she is ready to run blindfolded through the maze or room and stairs in the temple.
> - **Search**: She finally arrives at the top of the temple, where a single huge room rest peacefully behind sealed doors she needs to open with the Force.
>
> *(BUT in the throne room, she feels a presence (Exar-Kun) who appears as a ghost and talks to her. It tells her to be the spirit of a long-deceased Jedi, asking to be helped to find its resting place in the galaxy)*
> - **Find**: once in the throne room, Kith-shan encounters the ghost of Exar-Kun, who tries to seduce her in helping him to find its resting place.
> - **Take**: She realises that the place is deep into the Dark Side of the Force, that seems to be stemming out from the presence itself.
>
> *(THEREFORE she needs to decide how to treat the presence while she will be tempted to help the presence to find its resting place in the galaxy)*
> - **Return**: Kith-shan realises the presence has much more to do with the Siths than with the Jedi, and this is perceived by Exar-Kun, who tries to enslave her.
> - **Change**: She can decide how to manage the spirit of Exar-Kun and run back to her Master to tell him what's hidden in the throne room.

This longer form adds many more details to the session. It is now much easier to start plotting scenes and giving more definition to the world. In some occasions this is more than enough to run a session; however, the devil is in the details, and more often than not, Storytellers fail to consider what the player characters should **do**.

### Scene

A scene is, first and foremost, a moment in which the player characters must **do** something. A scene must prepare an action the player characters should do. Without an action, the scene is just a story, which after a while becomes boring.

Once you have your [ABT](#abt) and [Story Circle](#story-circle) [session](#session) plots ready, you can dig deeper in the smaller plot: the scene. In here, the way forward deviates sensibly from everything you have learned so far. A scene plot does not deal with [ABT](#abt) or [Story Circle](#story-circle), as a scene is extremely limited in time and has goals which are different from the previously discussed plots. It is safe to say that a scene does not have a proper plot.

The number of scenes you should write per-session depends entirely on your tabletop role playing game group.

So, how is a scene built? Well, in its shortest form, a scene has three attributes:  a title, a trigger and a required action. Additionally, the scene can contain a goal, some notes and different [building blocks](#the-building-blocks-of-your-world) of the [world building](#world-building).

- **Title**: for ease of reference I title every scene, referring to the stage of the [Story Circle Session Plot](#session). This title is written so that I should understand what I am talking about immediately.
- **Trigger**: the trigger tells how a scene comes to life, or more simply how and when it starts. This is important as it helps you, the Storyteller, to present it in the best possible way.
- **Required Action**: this is by far **the most important thing you can write down for each scene** and it is the description of what the player characters are supposed to do. Don't underestimate this part, as it is equally challenging to consider and easy to oversee. Without it, the scene becomes a boring set of information you impose on the players (sometimes is needed, but it is much more fun if the player characters must do something to gain those information). Generally I like to start the required action with a verb (*investigate*, *convince*, *fight*, *discuss*, *decide*, *unlock*, ...) because it forces me to put myself in the player characters' shoes.
- **Notes**: sometimes a scene can have complex interactions. I use the notes to summarise everything the player characters need to live or understand in a bullet list. Remember that reading while being the Storyteller is not easy, so make sure everything is easily consumable during the session.
- **Building Blocks**: in here I list every building block I have previously written during my [world building](#world-building) which are relevant for the scene. I like to have links to the extended descriptions in my [world building](#world-building), so I can easily read my notes.

You may notice that I don't write a description or a goal for each scene. I find those information redundant. As long as I have clear how to trigger the scene and what the player characters have to do, the rest is either obvious (*the goals for example*) or can be improvised (*the descriptions as example*).

> *(She realises that the place is deep into the Dark Side of the Force, that seems to be stemming out from the presence itself.)*
> - **The Dark Side is strong in this place (*Take*)**
>  - **Trigger**: While Kith-shan is talking to the spirit of Exar-Kun, she starts feeling cold
>  - **Action**: Kith-shan should reach her surrounding through the Force, and see the world through it, realising that the Dark Side seems to be coming from the tomb itself.
>
> *(Kith-shan realises the presence has much more to do with the Siths than with the Jedi, and this is perceived by Exar-Kun, who tries to enslave her.)*
> - **In the enemy's nest (*Return*)**
>  - **Trigger**: Exar-Kun will realise Kith-shan has perceived the Dark Side emanating from the tomb, and wants to make sure she pities her.
>  - **Action**: realise that the Dark Side comes from the spirit, not just from the tomb
>  - **Notes**:
>    - Exar-Kun will look at the tomb, trying to pity Kith-shan: "*I have been forced to live in a place strong in the Dark Side. I won't deny my faith was tested, but I am one with the Light Side of the Force, and the Force is one with me.*"
>
> *(Kith-shan realises the presence has much more to do with the Siths than with the Jedi, and this is perceived by Exar-Kun, who tries to enslave her.)*
> - **I want your body (*Return*)**
>  - **Trigger**: Exar-Kun will reach for Kith-shan, trying to possess her body, she will feel a cold like she never felt before.
>  - **Action**: Reach through the Force and repell Exar-Kun
>  - **Notes**:
>    - Exar-Kun is sloppy here, and he will go for speed more than precision. It will be simple for Kith-shan to repel him.

## World Building

World building is the process of creating a set of information around the world your player characters will live in. It does not necessarily means you have to start drawing maps and lores, but it might if you are creating a brand new world.

In line with the simplicity used so far, world building is about writing building blocks that will help you managing a consistent game, with a list of information always available. It will also help your players, as you will be able to conjure up details quickly and consistently, which will enhance their enjoyment.
