# RAW TL;DR

# Character Creation

1. **Distribute Ability Points:** Allocate 120 points across the abilities (Athletics,Art and Craft,Drive/Pilot,Education,Empathy/Psychology,Intimidate/Persuade,Investigation,Medicine,Melee Combat,Occult/Magic,Perception,Ranged Combat,Stealth/Survival,TechnologyWillpower)
2. **Calculate Passive Abilities:** Every 20 points in an ability grants 1 passive point, for automatic skills like defence.
3. **Determine Life Points:** Total of 20 plus passive willpower and athletics scores, indicating health and endurance.
4. **Develop Character Story:** Create a backstory, including past influences, goals, and personality traits.

## Actions Resolution

- Roll a d20, add it to the relevant ability score.
- Successes are calculated by dividing the total score by 20 (one success every 20 points)
- Compare the successes against a success threshold (set by the GM) to determine the outcome.
- For opposed actions, successes must be higher than opponent passive ability

## Combat

- No initiative; player characters act first, followed by NPCs.
- Attacks involve rolling a d20, adding the relevant combat ability score. 1 success or more hits
- Damage equals weaponâ€™s rating multiplied by the number of successes.
- Defending removes damage from each attack: passive melee or athletics plus armour rating subtracted from incoming damage.
- Multiple attacks possible but with increasing penalties.
